android-ago
==========

This library provides `RelativeTimeTextView`, a custom `TextView` that takes a reference time and always displays the relative time with respect to the reference point, **automatically refreshing the display text as needed**. This is a common pattern seen in several apps like chat apps, social networking, email etc.

![Here is a screenshot from the sample app][1]

This library can be seen as a wrapper on top of the excellent `android.text.format.DateUtils` class. Note that the library does _not_ expose all the options provided by the `DateUtils` class. I have left out many features because I couldn't decide what would be the best way to achieve the flexibility - dozens of XML attributes? Contributions in this regard are welcome.


Obtaining
=========

###Android Studio
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Open build.gradle in the root folder of the cloned project in Android Studio

###Eclipse+ADT
  1. Clone the repo
  2. In Eclipse, go to `File` -> `New` -> `Other`. Expand `Android` and select `Android Project from Existing Code`
  3. Browse to the `android-ago` sub-folder of the cloned repo and hit `Finish`

###Maven Central
This project is not available on Maven Central yet. Please follow #3 to know when this is done.

### From Gradle
If you are using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) as your dependency manager, you can simply add [Android-Ago repository](https://github.com/macksuelsantos/android-ago/raw/master/repo) and its dependency in your `build.gradle` file, as the example below.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.12.+'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

apply plugin: 'android'

repositories {
  maven { url 'https://github.com/macksuelsantos/android-ago/raw/master/repo' }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:19.0.1'
  compile 'com.github.curioustechizen.ago:Android-Ago-lib:0.1.0'
}


Usage
=====

  - Include `RelativeTimeTextView` in your layouts. 
  - Set the reference time either using `setReferenceTime` method or using the XML attribute `reference_time`.
  - Optionally, you can set a prefix using `relative_time_prefix` through XML or `setPrefix` from Java code.
  - Similarly, you can set a suffix using `relative_time_suffix` through XML or `setSuffix` from Java code.

In your layout:
```xml
<com.github.curioustechizen.ago.RelativeTimeTextView
    android:id="@+id/timestamp"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:relative_time_prefix="Completed "
    android:layout_marginTop="@dimen/margin_primary" />
```

In your Java code:
```java
RelativeTimeTextView v = (RelativeTimeTextView)findViewById(R.id.timestamp); //Or just use Butterknife!
v.setReferenceTime(new Date().getTime());
```

See the sample project for a concrete example.


Why is this library even needed?
======

One might ask, why not just use `DateUtils` directly? Well, the answer is that the custom `TextView` provided by this library is responsible for keeping track of its own reference time and of updating the display text over regular periodic intervals. It is also responsible for scheduling (or cancelling a scheduled) update of the display text. All you have to do is set the reference time once.
